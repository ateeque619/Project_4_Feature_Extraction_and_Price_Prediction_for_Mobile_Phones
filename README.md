# Mobile Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the price of mobile phones based on various features such as RAM, ROM, processor, camera specifications, battery capacity, and more. We will utilize machine learning techniques to build a model capable of accurately predicting the price of new and upcoming mobile phones.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project contains information on mobile phone prices and their corresponding features. We will perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and analysis to prepare the data for model training.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** We will load and clean the data, handling missing values, converting categorical features to numerical representations, and scaling features for optimal model performance.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We will perform EDA to gain insights into the data, including analyzing the relationship between features and the target variable (price), visualizing data distributions, and identifying correlations between variables.
3. **Feature Engineering:** We will potentially create new features from existing ones to enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships between features and the target variable.
4. **Feature Selection:** We will identify the most important features for predicting the price using techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance scores from models, and statistical tests.
5. **Dimensionality Reduction:** We might implement techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features and prevent overfitting, particularly if the dataset has a high number of features.
6. **Model Building:** We will train various regression models, such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
7. **Ensemble Methods:** We will explore ensemble methods, such as AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting, to potentially improve the model's predictive capabilities.
8. **Model Evaluation:** We will evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
9. **Model Selection:** We will choose the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics and other relevant considerations.
10. **Visualization:** We will visualize the predicted vs. actual prices and other key insights to better understand the model's performance and the factors influencing the price.
11. **Conclusion and Insights:** We will summarize the project's key findings, recommendations for pricing and product development, and potential areas for future improvement.
12. **Learning Outcomes:** We will outline the skills and knowledge gained through this project.

## Key Findings
We will detail the key insights obtained from the EDA, feature importance analysis, and model performance evaluation.
We will discuss the correlation between features like RAM, ROM, processor, camera, battery, and price.

## Model Performance

We will compare the performance of different models we have trained and discuss the reasons behind the choice of the final model.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
We will summarize the findings of the project and suggest potential recommendations for business decisions based on the predictions and insights derived from the analysis.
We will discuss potential improvements that could be explored in the future, such as incorporating more features or exploring more advanced models.

## Learning Outcomes
We will list the key skills and knowledge gained throughout this project.
This includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature selection, model building, evaluation, visualization, and interpretation.
